This is an attempt to make an LSTM (using Theano) that is able to remember images with an associated word and recall them when that word is given to it as an input.

To run it execute the file train.py

Currently it learns 32x32 pixel images and is able to recall them perfectly. Included are 10 such images to train the net with. Large numbers of images have not been tested yet.
